First, import book_data module and sys module
  book_data module is used for add, remove, update, and find option 
  sys module used for quit function using "q" or "quit"

Second, create user-defined functions to create section dividers, quit option, and instructions 
  Section divider uses Newline(): print("-" *25)
  Quit option uses quitShelf()
  Instructions uses instructions() and returns a description about the main options the program provides, how to use them, and how they will look like. 

Third, introduction into the program with a summary of what the program can do. 
  Create a variable to define filename into books.json
  This is so users can view their bookshelf in json format in the program
  Export option is so users can export thier bookshelf into csv
  Create a choice input option for users to view the instructions or go straight to the Main Menu
    Use while loop for users choose Y or N
      Y means yes:
        Y should print the user function "instructions" 
      N means no: 
        Use pass for loop to continue to Main menu options
In the main menu, include the options in a while loop:
    Options should be: Add, Remove, Update, Find, Save, View, Export, and Quit
    "A" and "1" = Add a book
    "R" and "2" = Remove a book
    "U" and "3" = Update a book
    "F" and "4" = Find a book
    "S" and "5" = Save your Collection
    "V" and "6" = View your Collection 
    "X" and "7" = Export to CSV
    "Q" = Quit
